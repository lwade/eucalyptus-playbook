This is a placeholder for Eucalyptus Ansible playbooks. Work in progress! :) 

Assuming your systems are configured to use sudo and your userid is added to the sudoers file along with your ssh public key on the servers, run with:

ansible-playbook eucalyptus.yml --private-key=/home/<me>/.ssh/<mykey> -s --ask-sudo-pass

The playbook currently only installs an NC.  It uses a hosts group "nc", ensure this is declared in /etc/ansible/hosts before running (or edit it out).
